# Seattle-parks
An analysis of bicycle and pedestrian trail usage at Myrtle Edwards Park in Seattle during Covid-19.
The graphs do not render well in Github but you can view them along with the entire notebook here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kglenn10/Seattle-parks/blob/master/API%20Version%20-%20Elliott%20Bay%20Trail.ipynb
This is a work in progress, so excuse the comments and notes! They will help keep me on track as I continue to develop this.
