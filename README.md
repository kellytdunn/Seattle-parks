# Seattle-parks
An analysis of bicycle and pedestrian trail usage at Myrtle Edwards Park in Seattle during Covid-19.

The graphs do not render well in Github but you can view them along with the entire notebook in a static format here, which is good if you are new to Jupyter notebooks: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kellytdunn/Seattle-parks/blob/master/Trail%20Usage%20Analysis.ipynb

If you want to run the notebook yourself, you can use mybinder: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kellytdunn/Seattle-parks/50b731727edb1c17b7175f59176faecee35200d3
This is a work in progress, so excuse the comments and notes! They will help keep me on track as I continue to develop this.
