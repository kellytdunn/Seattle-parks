# Seattle-parks
An analysis of bicycle and pedestrian trail usage at Myrtle Edwards Park in Seattle during Covid-19.

The graphs do not render well in Github but you can view them along with the entire notebook in a static format here, which is good if you are new to Jupyter notebooks: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16Hk8vJfB_Ka9EumaL6JtQL-ZJfDzKed7?usp=sharing. 

If you would like to try running it yourself, copy the notebook above to your own Google Drive, and get your own API tokens using the links provided in the notebook.
