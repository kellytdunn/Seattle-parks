# Seattle-parks
An analysis of bicycle and pedestrian trail usage at Myrtle Edwards Park in Seattle during Covid-19.
The graphs currently do not render well in Github or in nbviewer, which I am working to correct. 
Once it's fixed you'll be able to view them along with the entire notebook here: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kglenn10/Seattle-parks/blob/master/Elliott%20Bay%20Trail.ipynb
